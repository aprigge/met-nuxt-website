        title="What"
        text="This project is a Nuxt App that queries and presents collection data from the Met Museum's Collections API. The Nuxt app creates a page for each object ID in the url and presents the image, some metadata, and the entire JSON response. More features coming soon!"
      />
      <text-block
        title="Why"
        text="I have an Art History degree and have always been interested in Humanities data. I was looking for interesting data sources and found the Met Museum had published a REST API. I built this Nuxt app because I wanted to highlight skills I havenâ€™t applied to other work projects."
      />
      <text-block
        title="Next Steps"
        text="So many features I would love to build! Including a search wrapper for the API, adding cypress tests, and optimizing the API queries."
